# splice framework #

## what it is ##
* a minuscule php framework modeled off of codeigniter

## url routing ##
like codeigniter, the url routes adhere to the format mysite.com/controller/function/param1/param2/etc...

##Setup##
* modify .htaccess with the correct paths
* modify index.php with the correct paths
* modify app/config/config.php with default models and libraries


##Notes##
the index.php/controller/function/param1/param2/etc... url scheme will not work with the current .htaccess rewrite rules for reasons I have yet to delve into
